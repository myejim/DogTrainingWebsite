    <h2>About Miles Parker</h2>
    <p>
        Miles Parker started training with his Bull-terrier, Bella, in 2007.
        After realizing he had a talent in training he decided to go get his certificates and start an official business, Paw-radise.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now with three certificates under his belt and hundreds of positive 
        testimonies Miles is a renowned trainer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Miles particularly specializes in agression, on and off leash training,
        obedience, and behavioral.
    </p>
    <p>
        When not training Miles can be found hiking with his new Bull-terrier,
        Max, playing basketball, tending to his garden, and reading up on new methods
        of dog training.
